## Description

The New Genius Candles AI MT5 is an advanced trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It utilizes cutting-edge AI algorithms and proprietary strategies to analyze market data and make informed trading decisions. The robot is designed to detect candlestick patterns, predict price movement, analyze historical data, and update the trading strategy periodically.

## Features

- Candlestick Pattern Detection: The robot implements a proprietary algorithm to detect candlestick patterns in real-time. It returns true if a pattern is detected and false otherwise.

- Price Movement Prediction: The Core AI model is utilized to forecast future price movements. The predicted price movement value is returned for decision making.

- Data Analysis: The robot employs AI algorithms to analyze historical prices, trading volumes, news events, and technical indicators. The analysis results are stored for informed decision making.

- Informed Decision Making: The robot retrieves the analyzed data and makes an informed decision on buying or selling assets based on the data. It returns true for buying and false for selling.

- Trading Strategy Updates: The trading strategy is updated every two weeks to adapt to changing market conditions. The robot identifies the best possible entry points based on the updated strategy.

## Usage

The main function of the robot is the `OnTick()` function, which is executed on each tick of the market. Here is how the code works:

1. The robot checks for a candlestick pattern by calling the `detectCandlestickPattern()` function.

2. If a pattern is detected, the robot proceeds to predict the price movement by calling the `predictPriceMovement()` function.

3. The historical data is then analyzed using AI algorithms by calling the `analyzeData()` function.

4. Based on the analyzed data, the robot makes an informed decision on buying or selling assets by calling the `makeInformedDecision()` function.

5. If the decision is to buy, the robot places a buy order based on the predicted movement. If the decision is to sell, the robot places a sell order.

6. The robot also checks if it's time to update the trading strategy. If the time interval is reached (every two weeks), the `updateTradingStrategy()` function is called to update the strategy.
